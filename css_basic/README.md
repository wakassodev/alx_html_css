## Key Concepts

### 1. Selectors

Understanding CSS selectors is essential for styling specific HTML elements. This project demonstrates the use of different types of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. Selectors help target and style specific elements on the page.

### 2. Box Model

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that defines the layout and spacing of elements. This project explores the box model's components, including content, padding, border, and margin. Proper utilization of the box model ensures consistent spacing and layout.

### 3. Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout model that simplifies the design of complex layouts. This project introduces the basics of flex containers and flex items. Flexbox allows for efficient alignment and distribution of elements, creating flexible and responsive designs.

### 4. Responsive Design

Responsive design ensures a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes. This project incorporates media queries to adjust styles based on the device's characteristics. Learn how to create a responsive layout that adapts to different viewing environments.
